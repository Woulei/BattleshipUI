# Battleschip UI

## About
This is a simple React app build during the Codaisseur Academy. It has a very simple version custom made version of the Battleships game. It also has a simple chat function. We build it as a hackathon project within 5 days. We used a boilerplate app with simple login/singup and chat functions.

The game itself has been build by us. Images and movies were found on the internet.

You can visit a live version here: [Battleship Game](http://battleships-ui.bitballoon.com/)

__NOTE:__ This was build during the Academy. If we would build it again, we might do it differently. Also the finishing touches were skipped due to the small amount of time available. The Battleship API and APP were build within less then 5 days by a team of 3 people. It might contain some minor bugs, and might see some features added later. ;-)

### ToDo's
  * Fix the bugs
  * Show who's turn it is
  * Build a better, more visible api loading indicator
  * Make the player's choose where their ships will be on the grid
### Known bug's
  * When you make a move while it is not your turn, you get redirected to the sign-in page.
  * 'waiting for other player button' in the Lobby isn't long enough. Maybe show a smaller text?
  * AppBar in the chat screen is nearly invisible.
